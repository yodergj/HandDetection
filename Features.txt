Center of mass

Min and max distance to edge

Angle bentween min and max edge distances - lines might be good for aligning the hand in some poses

Concavity - centroid not in mass, extend alignment from centroid and look for on/off pattern

Need some method for finding bumps - number and relative position and magnitude relative to alignment lines

offset between centroid and center of bounding box

concentric rings around centroid - mass per ring, num gaps in ring, gap center angles to alignment lines

texture calculcations from flesh region - possibly helpful for removing non-hand regions and false positives touching the hand
